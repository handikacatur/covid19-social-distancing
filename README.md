# Covid-19 Social Distancing Project With CNN
The year 2020 is a terrible year. There has been a pandemic outbreak that force people to keep their distance from each other. This project is using machine learning to detect how many people in limited space with pre-determined limits, then classify it into two classes. The goal is to label any given image whether it meets the social distancing requirement or not.

## The dataset
We are using [Crowd Counting](https://www.kaggle.com/fmena14/crowd-counting) dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/). It is a huge dataset taken frame to frame from a video recorded by a webcam in a mall. It contains more than 2000 images and each one is labeled by the number of people.

Note:
Might need some tuning to optimize learning process and prediction
